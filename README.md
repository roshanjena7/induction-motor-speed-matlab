# Induction Motor Speed Analysis using MATLAB

## Objective
To analyze the speed response of an induction motor using numerical methods in MATLAB.

## Description
This project models the motor dynamics using torque balance equations and solves them using ODE45.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB R2025b

## Methodology
- Define motor parameters
- Formulate speed differential equation
- Solve using numerical integration
- Plot speed-time response

## Results
The motor accelerates smoothly from standstill and reaches steady-state speed.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates MATLAB-based modeling of electrical machines without Simulink.
